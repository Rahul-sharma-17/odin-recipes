    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This green bean casserole with canned beans and French-fried onions is a holiday favorite with my family, and it's easy to make. The beloved dish has been a Thanksgiving tradition since it was created in 1955 by Dorcas Reilly, a chef from the Campbell's Test Kitchen. Campbell's printed the recipe right on the label of their soup cans and the rest is history!
